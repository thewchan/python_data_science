0,"Preliminary:Two snowboarders left Snowbasin Resort, entering Hell's Canyon via the marked access gate in the photo below.  Hells Canyon is out-of-bounds terrain, beyond Snowbasin's boundary.  After a few turns, they decided to traverse back right and try to return to Snowbasin.  The first person, 21 year old Blake Ford, triggered an avalanche while crossing the top of a steep, northerly facing gully and was caught.  The slide was about 3 feet deep, fairly narrow, and possibly triggered in a shallow rocky area.  Blake was carried 1500 vertical feet, and buried about 3 feet deep near the toe of the slide.  The path is a confined gully. His partner immediately searched the slide path, but did not find the totally buried Blake.  Neither person had an avalanche beacon or avalanche rescue gear.  The partner then contacted Snowbasin patrol via cell phone and headed to the Snowbasin base area to meet patrollers.However, the rescue had already started, within minutes of the avalanche.   The slide was witnessed by Snowbasin patroller Cory Krusey, who was several hundred feet below, just inside the resort boundary. He immediately alerted the patrol, initiating the rescue. Significant avalanche danger remained.  A hasty party of 3 people and an avalanche dog were sent in.  They used explosives to help secure the rescue site, triggering two very small slides along the flanks.  The hasty party searched the path to the toe of the slide, where the body was found by Snowbasin's avalanche dog.  A secondary rescue team went in to assist.  Significant trauma existed.  The body was removed by Life Flight Air Ambulance using a winch cable system.",North,Persistent Slab,Soft Slab,1,,1,1,,"Preliminary:It was unsafe to access the crown face or flanks of the avalanche on March 4th or 5th.

All of our information is from Search and Rescue teams or Lone Peak Fire who responded to the accident.Below are comments about the accident which are based on my opinion.I believe this was a case of 'innocent ignorance' as I suspect no one in the party had any idea that they were in avalanche terrain.  This is not to say they are stupid, just unaware.  It is easy to think this way with the avalanche site so close to the road.  However, all you need is a steep enough slope with snow on it and you're in avalanche terrain, no matter how close to a road or civilization you are.I regularly spend time doing field work in the Provo area mountains and it is not uncommon to see snowshoers or snowshoe tracks in the bottom of gullies.  Many of these gullies are fairly small and seem unassuming to someone who has no avalanche education.  Also, they are often the path of least resistance for traveling so it is understandable why we see people in these gullied 'terrain traps'.Brett Kobernik",,"18""",6400,,1,Near Tibble Fork Reservoir,"Saturday, February 8, 2014",Kobernik - Tremper,,"Saturday, February 8, 2014","Saturday, February 8, 2014",,,"It was a steep gully with a stream at the bottom.  The avalanche descended just a short distance of about 125 feet into a creek, where the woman was buried face first in the water.  The Tibble Fork Resivoir area is a popular destination and trailhead and most of the terrain in the immediate area is fairly gentle.  But this particular, steep gully is between the reservoir and the main parking lot, just north of the road.  The site of the burial was only about 200 feet off the road.  These steep gullies are what we call 'terrain traps' because if an avalanche occurs, the snow and anyone caught has nowhere to go and ends up 'trapped' very deep at the bottom of the gully.  In this particular case, if the party would have walked on the north side of the creek, they would not have been caught even if an avalanche did occur.",Snowshoer,Unintentionally Triggered,125,,New Snow/Old Snow Interface,"The largest snow storm of the winter deposited over a couple feet of new snow at higher elevations but at 6,400' it was a mix of rain and snow as the rain-snow line was rising all day.

4,"This is a preliminary avalanche accident report and we will add additional information and videos to it as time allows.  Please contact Utah Department of Transportation for all media inquiries.Quite a large group of people went in together to investigate the avalanche.  There was 5 Utah Department of Transportation forecasters including Chris Covington, Matt McKee, Bill Nalli, Adam Nesbitt and Steven Clark.  From the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center there was Drew Hardesty, Trent Meisenheimer and myself (Bruce Tremper) totaling eight people.The victim was Craig Patterson, a forecaster for the Utah Department of Transportation Snow and Avalanche Program, which forecasts and controls avalanches for both Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon.  Craig was doing fieldwork alone on Kessler Peak to check out the snow stability conditions, because avalanche slopes on Kessler Peak can threaten the highway below.Craig followed a fairly standard up-track used by both public backcountry skiers and by UDOT forecasters, which utilizes a thickly-treed ridge between avalanche paths locally known as God's Lawnmower, which is just west of the ridge and Kessler Slabs, which is just to the east of the ridge. He ascended the ridge using climbing skins and made switchbacks up the northeast-facing ridge.  As he neared the top of the ridge where he presumably planned to descend back down the ridge he ascended, his ascension track led around a corner from the northeast-facing ridge onto a steep, east-facing slope where he presumably triggered the avalanche that killed him.  The flank fracture of the slab was directly on the sharp ridge that divided the safer snow on the northeast facing slope from what appeared to be recently wind loaded snow on the east facing slope.  The distance of only a foot or two separated safe snow from dangerous snow.  It's uncertain whether he was planning to make another switchback to stay on the safer north facing side and just stepped around the corner too far or whether he planned to continue onto the east facing slope to examine the snow there.The avalanche was a relatively small wind slab, about 6-8 inches deep (a foot deep in the deepest section) and about 45 feet wide.  It was on a very steep slope, which was 50 degrees at the crown face and 45 degrees where his track led across the flank wall of the slab fracture.  It's likely that the avalanche broke 40' above him as he stepped onto to the recently wind-loaded slope.  The avalanche path descends through many sparse trees and over a couple cliffs.  The avalanche swept him 1380' vertical feet down the slope where he came to rest on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed.He checked in by phone around 1:00 or 1:30 in the afternoon when he was high on the mountain and reported stable snow conditions. He failed to check in later in the day nor return home that evening so the authorities were notified.  His UDOT truck was still parked at the Cardiff Fork trailhead. A Life Flight helicopter was able to fly just before dark to search for him and they noticed the avalanche with a person on top of the debris and not moving, but the terrain was too steep to land.  Ground-based rescuers from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue under the command of Salt Lake County Sheriff accessed the area on foot after dark.  They found Craig's body on the surface of the debris with his avalanche airbag deployed and obvious trauma to his head and hip with rips in his pants.  He was obviously still in ""uphill mode"" as he will had a climbing skin on his ski (the other ski was missing) and he was dressed lightly.  He was laying head downhill and on his side.   His body was only about 50' vertical feet above the toe of the debris.View of the accident site from the Big Cottonwood Canyon road.  The victim followed a standard climbing track up the northeast facing, densely-treed ridge and on his top diagonal, he crossed around a corner onto an east facing slope and triggered an avalanche, which descended down a different drainage than the one he ascended.This is the site where the victim was found on the snow surface with his avalanche airbag deployed.  He was located where the person in the shadows is standing, which is about 50 vertical feet above the toe of the avalanche debris.The victim's tracks are presumably the ones in the bottom of the photo and they lead into the flank wall of the avalanche he probably triggered.  It's unknown whether he was doing another switchback and strayed too far onto the steeper, more east-facing slope or whether he intended to examine the snow there.  The avalanche was a wind slab that was only about 8 inches deep and 45 feet wide but it was enough to catch him and sweep him down the steep slope.Looking down the slope, which is quite steep--45 degrees where he stepped onto the slope and 50 degrees at the crown face.  It drains through many sparse trees and over a couple cliffs on the way down.Looking downhill, you can see his ascent track on the left of the photo coming up towards the camera.  He ascended the gentler, northeast facing slope and then crossed over a divide in the center of the photo onto a steeper, east facing slope on the right of the photo (where the avalanche occurred)  that had different snow characteristics due to the different aspect with respect to wind and sun.",East,Wind Slab,Soft Slab,,,1,1,"After seeing the accident site and the avalanche conditions, we all agreed that it was the kind of accident that could have happened to any of us.  In the mountains, sometimes the snowpack can vary dramatically with subtle variations in terrain and only a step too far can have huge consequences.  It was a sad day for all of us to lose a friend, a co-worker and such a wonderful person.The accident was especially tragic because the victim, Craig Patterson, was not only a skilled forecaster but he was widely loved and admired.  He was, smart, a great public speaker and teacher and one of the finest human beings most of us had met.  Most tragic of all, he left behind a wife and a 6-year-old daughter.Special thanks to Wasatch Backcountry Rescue and Salt Lake County Search and Rescue for their hard, and sometimes dangerous work.  We are all very lucky to have such a great rescue team.Final note: since he appeared to die from trauma and he was on the snow surface, having a partner with him probably would not have changed the outcome of this accident.

But from what we found, we all agreed the slab was composed of wind drifted snow, which slid on the sun crust, which was about 6-12 inches below the snow surface.  In some places there appeared to be some weak snow on top of the sun crust--perhaps radiation-recrystallization crust, and on one flank there was obviously a small patch of faceted snow under the slab.  I suspect that most of the slab simply slid on the interface between the new, windblown snow and the ice crust.We did not notice any unstable snow conditions on the ascent route.  We assumed that the winds from the northwest the previous day and the morning of the accident had drifted snow onto the east facing slope where the avalanche occurred.The Utah Avalanche Center avalanche advisory rated the danger as Moderate for localized wind slabs and for wet avalanches from rapid warming.Trent Meisenheimer, Drew Hardesty and I are examining the fracture line of the avalanche to determine the snow structure.  UDOT avalanche forecasters are coming onto the slope below to also examine the snowpack.","The slope where the avalanche occurred was very steep--50 degrees at the crown face and 45 degrees where his track led onto the slope.  The slope continues at around 45 degrees and strains through many sparse trees and at least two ~ 10' cliffs.   With so many obstacles, it would have been unlikely to survive an avalanche on that slope.  The slope is east facing with the crown face at 9921' and the bottom edge of the debris at 8540'.  The starting zone is slightly bowl-shaped, about 50' wide and it obviously collects wind drifted snow both from north and south winds.",Skier,,1500,,New Snow/Old Snow Interface,"I will fill in the details here later, but basically there were two snowstorms accompanied by wind in the 5 days previous to the accident that deposited new snow on top of a pre-existing sun crust.  Most of the snow had stabilized but there were lingering pockets of wind slabs and rapid warming on sun exposed slopes exacerbated the instability.  Thursday - April 11's quick storm deposited 4-8"" in the morning with gusty northwest winds along the high ridgelines.

5,We have not spoken with anyone who was involved in that accident. The following accident summary was related to us through the Sevier County Sheriff.A group of snowmobilers left 12 mile Canyon for a day of snowmobiling.  Just east of the head of 12 mile Canyon the group was playing in a broad flat bottom valley with small steep slopes on the west side.  The group was separated some what as everyone was having fun on different terrain features. At about 4 o'clock or a bit later the group noticed that one member was missing. They backtracked a bit to find a fresh avalanche and figured he must be buried in it. There was no sign of him or his snowmobile and he was not wearing an avalanche beacon. The group was not able to locate him and were forced to call search and rescue.  The search and rescue team arrived and was able to finally locate part of the buried snowmobile. The victim ended up being buried beneath the snowmobile and the rescue team extricated him but it was too late.  The victim was a 30 year old male buried at least 4 feet deep.,Northeast,Persistent Slab,Soft Slab,1,,1,1,"FORECASTER COMMENTS:It is not uncommon for groups of snowmobilers to get scattered about in play areas but, obviously, this poses a serious risk when someone climbs a steep slope without a partner watching them. The only sure way of staying out of an avalanche is to stay off and out from under all slopes that are 30° in steepness or steeper.  However, many of us, including myself, choose to recreate in avalanche terrain.One of the methods that I use to reduce my risk is to closely follow the snowpack progression on certain steep slopes throughout the entire winter. This way I am aware of any weak layers that form. I then know if it is safe to get onto these steep slopes after every subsequent snowstorm.It is a risky endeavor to draw conclusions about a slope with out actually getting on to it and digging into the snow.  This takes a high level of avalanche skill and years of assessing snowpack layering to be able to determine how much new snow and wind a certain slope can withstand before avalanching.Keeping track of certain slopes may seem unreasonable if you only get out a few times a winter or travel to many different areas.  Also, you can literally get on to hundreds of avalanche slopes in one day on a snowmobile.  How is a person supposed to be able to keep track?  It is near impossible and without knowing the underlying structure of the snowpack, it's a 'crap shoot' getting onto steep avalanche terrain.A good line of defense if you are going to risk getting into steep terrain is to learn to recognize buried weak sugarary snow and learn to recognize when a slab has formed on top of it.Brett KobernikAvalanche ForecasterUtah Avalanche Center",,2',10400,,1,Southern end of the Manti Skyline just east out of 12 Mile Canyon,"Friday, March 1, 2013",Kobernik,,"Friday, March 1, 2013","Friday, March 1, 2013",38,,"The slope was an average of 38 degrees in steepness but rolled over to 40 degrees at the bottom.

It is about half the depth of areas above Fairview and Mt Pleasant.  A shallow snowpack is very susceptible to having weak sugary snow form especially in the cold months of December and January. This is exactly what happened this season and these weak layers that formed got buried by snow storms. A few snowmobile triggered avalanches in this region occurred in early February (Slide 1Slide 2)revealing the potential that these weak layers had. Snow storms in February along with some recent westerly winds created a slab on top of these weak layers. This region has a very shallow snowpack of only up to about 2 feet deep. A telltale sign of a slab over week sugary snow is when you notice your snowmobile track sinking through the upper layer and sandboxing in the sugary snow.,350,"39.043600000000, -111.519000000000",1,03/1/2013,Skyline,White Mountain,Snowmobiler,/avalanches/15884

7,"The following link gives good information from KSL:KSL LINKThe Accident:A group of 4 individuals from the Norwood, Colorado area decided to  go on a snowmobile tour from Gateway, Colorado and up into Beaver Basin  in the La Sal Mountains, Utah.  They started in the early morning.  It  was the first time to Beaver Basin of the season for the group leader,  who had been there twice before.  Another member of the party  snowmobiled in the area once before.  On their way to Beaver Basin, the  party did not notice any signs of instability.  Once in the basin  proper, snow conditions were getting deeper and on numerous occasions,  the more experience riders needed to circle back around to assist the  less experienced digging their snowmobiles out.The summer road did not have any noticeable snowmobile tracks, as  they continued up the group leader realized that they were entering a  land of diminishing returns...the amount of stuck snowmobiles and tough  going warranted the party to turn around.  But where?The first sign of instability the party encountered were roller balls  off a cliff band (avalanche terrain) less that 1/8 a mile from the  accident site.  The summer road in that area was too steep to stop (they  did not want to get stuck) to regroup and the group leader remembered a  meadow that could work as turn around point and regrouping area.   Unfortunately, this meadow was where the accident occurred.  The summer  road into Beaver Basin is affected by numerous avalanche paths, and this  clearing was a result of the classic avalanche path looming above.The first two snowmobiles crossed the avalanche path and regrouped on  the other side in the more protected part of the meadow.  As the third  snowmobile made its way across, the first two started to see ""snow dust""  coming down the avalanche path and waved the third on.  As the third  made it to the first two, the fourth snowmobile (victim) crested over  the top of the steep hill and into the avalanche path.  Vigorously  waving for him to cross, the ""snow dust"" turned into a powder cloud and  then debris and powder cloud obscured their vision for over 30 seconds.   Once the snow settled, the fourth snowmobile and his rider was nowhere  to be seen.  The party started to search for their partner immediately.Unfortunately, the party only had one beacon, one probe and two  shovels.  They started their search from the last seen point and  realized the force of the avalanche pushed the victim off the bench the  summer road was on and into a classic terrain trap: a steep gully.  They  had a very good feeling where he was buried: probed all over the place,  yet their probe could not reach the bottom of the debris (which in some  places was over 30' deep).  There was a potential probe strike:  the  party dug a six foot hole in this location...they were losing time.   Approximately 1 hr 45 min elapsed during this search and the party  realized they were outmatched to find their companion.  They left and  found cell service way down John Brown's Canyon on the way to Gateway.   The accident occurred around 10:30 am and Grand County Search and Rescue  received the call on 2:00 pm.The Rescue/Recovery:On Saturday afternoon, a hasty team of Grand County Winter Search and  Rescue members were flown in to the site.  The hasty team probed in  likely areas along the bench and in the ravine.  Once likely burial  areas were probed, a coarse probe search started from the last scene  point downhill while one of the hasty members continued to probe likely  areas in the ravine.  On a hunch (and a bit of luck) the spot probe  decided to probe the bottom of the hole already dug by the snowmobile  party.  It was determined a positive strike was made.  All efforts then  were diverted to determining the probe strike.  Upon digging to the end  of the probe utilizing the conveyor method, the cowling of the  snowmobile was uncovered.  No other actions could be done at this time  due to darkness and the victim was not positively found.On Sunday morning, March 4th, a large group of Mesa County and Grand  County Search and Rescue team members arrived on scene shortly after  10:00 am.  Over 50 rescuers contributed their time and effort in the  search.  In the beginning of the search, one team probed the entire  slide path along the bench below the last scene point while the second  group started to move a metric ton of avalanche debris below.  Once  the upper area was cleared, all rescue team members contributed to  digging out the victim and his snowmobile.  By noon, the victim was  identified and by 1300 was removed from the accident site.  He was found  approximately 3 feet uphill from his snowmobile and under at least 12'  of avalanche debris.",Southeast,,Soft Slab,1,,1,1,Our thoughts go out to the friends and family affected by this tragic accident.,,2',10200,,1,"Beaver Basin, La Sal Mountains near Moab","Sunday, March 4, 2012",Max Forgensi,Morning,"Saturday, March 3, 2012",Morning,10,,,Snowmobiler,Unintentionally Triggered,1000,,,,700,"38.539320000000, -109.209852000000",1,03/3/2012,Moab,Beaver Basin,Snowmobiler,/avalanches/18257
8,"Timothy Robert Baker, 24, died in an avalanche he triggered under the cliffs in Dutch Draw n February 23, 2012.This is information is from talking with the Canyons ski patrollers who responded to the accident and a visit to the site by UAC forecasters Evelyn Lees and Brett Kobernik.  More details may be added later if it is possible to interview the survivor.The accident occurred in Dutch Draw, a backcountry area south of the Canyons Resort.Timothy and his partner were on snowboards.  They left through the well marked boundary gate at the top of 9990 Lift and traversed south   It is believed both the victim and his partner descended about 150 or 200’ below the ridgeline and stopped near the cliffs.  Then Timothy descended the next section first, triggered a slab avalanche.  He was caught, carried and buried.  Neither he nor his partner were wearing a beacon or had rescue gear.Rescue:  Timothy’s partner immediately headed down to the debris and started searching.  As other backcountry travelers in adjacent area came into view, he called out for help, and a total of 8 people arrived.  One was sent for help.  The other 7 people searched the debris.  None of the parties were equipped with beacons or rescue gear. Some skiers popped the baskets off their poles and probed. One struck the victim’s snowboard and they started digging just as 2 Canyons ski patrollers  arrived on the scene.  Timothy was dug out, and a ski patroller and Timothy’s partner started CPR.  They transported the victim to a nearby flat area where a medical helicopter could land and transport the victim to the hospital. The victim was buried about 40 minutes. It is unknown if he died from trauma or asphyxiation.The victim was carried about 600 vertical feet, strained through small trees, and buried near the toe of the slide.  He buried head first downhill, face down, with his head approximately 3 feet below the snow surface in debris that was about 6 to 8 feet deep.  The snowboard was broken in half, but held together by some of the material.email from Jay Torgersen, Flight Paramedic, AirMedI was on the AirMed team that responded to the Canyons and worked with their Patrol on the side-country accident/fatality yesterday.  Our team was made up of Casey Thompson-RN, Troy Stanton-Pilot and myself.  Just wanted to pass on to your investigation team what a fantastic job the Canyon’s Patrol did coordinating the initial rescue effort.  It was a difficult and potentially dangerous situation that they handled extremely well.  It was evident that safety was their number one priority, not just for their own personnel but for those of us called in to assist.  They also had to consider the safety of bystanders and the victim’s party who were attempting a partner rescue.  There were several variables to consider in the cost versus benefit analysis faced by those running the incident.  Having experienced and organized incident commanders with well thought out strategic plans and back-ups allowed the operation to unfold without further incident or harm to all involved.  Without addressing the victims own personal preparedness, I don’t think there was anything that could have been done that would have changed the ultimate outcome.  The Canyon’s Patrol and the Summit County SO team should be commended for outstanding work performed in a stressful, challenging and extremely difficult environment.  Take care and be safe!

9,"Four snowmobile riders were out for a day of snowmobiling.  Rider A had recently opened a snowmobile shop in Richfield and had a fair bit of experience in avalanche country.  Rider B was a friend and had the most experience in avalanche terrain out of the group.  He was the most familiar with the terrain and perhaps has the best sense of snow stability.  Rider C was rider A's father.  Rider D was working for rider A and had very little experience on a sled and virtually no experience in avalanche terrain.  A, B, and C were carrying beacons, shovels and probes.  Rider D did not have avalanche gear.  Rider B had been to a few local avalanche training seminars with some field training also.  He states he is quite comfortable using his transceiver.Rider B said that they were out boondocking for the day with no intention of doing any hill climbing.  He was very aware of the dangerous weak snow near the ground as well as the recent snowfall which had created a slab which had produced a recent widespread natural avalanche cycle.At the end of the day, the group was going to exit the backcountry and they were looking for the fastest route out.  They chose to utilize a summer road that crossed an avalanche path.  Rider B had traveled down the road the previous week and his tracks were still visible.  It was 5pm or a little later.  He started up the road and was about half way across the path when he felt the entire pack move.  The next thing he knew, he was being pushed off the road.  He then said that snow was washing over him and he was engulfed.  Luckily, he was not knocked off the sled and was able to grab a full handful of throttle which propelled him back out of the churning snow and he was able to ride to safety.When he came to a stop, riders C and D were on the opposite side of the path and had not been caught.  Rider A was no where to be seen.  They speculated that Rider A had been following Rider B and had been buried but none of them had seen him get caught.Rider B and C turned their transceivers to receive and started the search.  They stated that there were some problems with cell phone interference and turned off their cell phones.  They were at the toe of the slide and started to walk uphill with their transceivers searching for a signal.  They were unable to locate an initial signal.  After an hour, it was decided that they needed to get outside help and ultimately, rider B rode to a location where his cell phone worked and called for help.  Upon his return, the group was able to spot part of Rider A's sled just sticking out of the snow.  It was well after dark at this point.  Upon nearing the buried sled, both transceivers started to receive a signal.  At this point, they quickly located Rider A who was buried under at least 4 feet of snow and downhill of the buried sled by about 50 feet.  They dug him up but it was too late.",North,,Hard Slab,1,,1,2,"Comments:  Rider B is very perplexed as to why neither he nor Rider C didn't pick up an initial signal quickly.  Rider B states they walked very close to where Rider A was found and did not receive a signal until later when they returned back down the path.Rider B was very adamant about staying off steep slopes during the day.  He stated that they would climb the avalanche slope under more stable conditions but were not willing to do it this season.  He admits that it was foolish to use the road which cuts through the path.  He states that their choice was made out of being tired and wanting to head home the quickest way.To me, this is an easy mistake to make.  The road is a very pronounced cut through the slope which I could see could give a false sense of security, although Rider B openly states he knew better.  Taking short cuts while being fatigued is a common theme in accidents and is a very easy mistake to make. These guys were correct in avoiding any hill climbing because of known avalanche danger but the rush to get ""back to the barn"" caused them to chance crossing the exact slope that they were not willing to climb.  Thank you Rider B for being willing to talk about this incident which, hopefully, others can learn from.",,3',9800,,1,West of Lost Creek Reservoir,"Sunday, February 5, 2012","Kobernik, Meisenheimer, Rasmussen",5:00pm,"Sunday, February 5, 2012",5:00pm,36,,,Snowmobiler,Unintentionally Triggered,350,,Facets,,1/4 mile,"38.716456000000, -111.721988000000",1,02/5/2012,Skyline,Lost Creek Reservoir,Snowmobiler,/avalanches/18157
10,"On the morning of Saturday January 28thfour people in two cars drove up Big Cottonwood Canyon with the intent to climb the Argenta Slide Path. About 1500’ into the climb, one member of the party didn’t feel well and headed back to his car to return home. The three remaining, one skier (Josh A.) and two split-boarders (Alecs B. and Justin S.), pressed on. They gained the ridge, bumped into a well-known local skier, where they stopped and talked for a few minutes.The three then headed south towards a steep, committing run north of the “Little Giant” located of the west face of Kessler Peak. Alecs Barton was in the lead and dropped into the slope while the other two maintained their spacing and watched their partner. Alecs descended through some trees and we he popped out onto the open slope he triggered a hard slab avalanche about 100’ above him at approx 11:22. The slide averaged3’ deep, was nearly 1000’ wide and ran 2,500’ vertically.After Alecs disappeared, Josh and Justin quickly formulated a game plan and began descending the narrow couloir.Half way down the chute they encountered a 30’ plus cliff band they had to negotiate. The two continued down slope and encountered yet another cliff band where they decided to call 911 at 11:29 while they still had a cell signal. Josh continued down slope into the avalanche debris filled gully. He got a signal, continued downhill, but quickly realized he was below his partner as the signal faded. He hiked uphill as Justin arrived and began probing. The first strike was a false positive and as Josh shoveled he realized he had hit a tree branch. Justin continued probing and struck Alecs foot moments later. The digging began and they uncovered his legs followed by the rest of his body. Josh and Justin began CPR. At this juncture the Wasatch Powderbird Guides (WPG) helicopter was heard in the canyon, but Josh and Justin noticed it was heading up canyon and away from them. Josh decided to pull his ABS so the heli could more easily spot them from the air. Within a few minutes the heli returned, was above them, and dropped off two members of Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) who assisted on scene.Given the terrain features this was remarkable rescue by not only the trained professionals of WPG and WBR, but also from Josh and Justin who maintained composure under extremely difficult physical and emotional conditions. The mere fact that they were able to negotiate the extremely challenging terrain which barely had enough snow left in it and continue with a solid well managed rescue is a testament to these two young men’s background in both mountaineering and medical training.All members of the party had avalanche rescue gear. It’s unclear if Alecs had consulted the avalanche advisory that morning, but he had been in the general area a few days before and was aware of the snowpack structure on nearby slopes. No snow pits were dug, but survivors indicated they tested the snow throughout the tour with pole stabs and felt good about stability. Both Alecs and his splitboarding partner were familiar with the terrain and had descended the slope at least once last season.",West,,Hard Slab,1,,1,1,"On the day of the avalanche, the advisory's bottom line read, ""Very dangerous conditions exist in the backcountry.There is aCONSIDERABLEavalanche dangerfor triggering deep slab avalanches and aMODERATE dangerfor triggering any new or old wind drifts.It’s not HIGH danger anymore, but the travel recommendations remain the same.I’d avoid the steep west to north to southeast facing slopes at the mid and upper elevations.It went on to say, ""t’s gonna be one of those days - Bluebird, light wind, 5 star powder (for this year anyway). Truth be told, it’s also days like these where we see avalanche accidents.Discipline, self-denial – these are things we not only aspire to – it’s what keeps us alive in conditions like these.

11,"Final Report  11/14/11   Thanks to the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Snow Safety for their assistanceTwo men in their 30s left the closed Alta ski area with the intent to ride the well known terrain of Alta and Snowbird.  Neither ski areas are open yet and have yet to conduct any avalanche control within their boundaries.  We interviewed the victim's ski partner.  To say he was shaken up is an understatement.While neither had any rescue gear or formal avalanche training, they were both expert skiers and knew the terrain well.  They had not consulted the avalanche advisory that morning in which the danger was rated Considerable to High.  They continued to Snowbird via Baldy and accessed the Peruvian Cirque to gain the Gad Valley.  While ascending out of the Peruvian Cirque they remotely triggered a large avalanche that covered their tracks that they had just made.  It's unclear whether they realized they had triggered this large avalanche.  They gained the ridge and prepared to drop into Gad Valley.With the partner watching, the victim dropped into the slope, immediately triggering the slide.  He was carried approximately 800 feet through steep rocky terrain and reportedly went over a small cliff band and came to a stop only partially buried.  The partner went down to help the victim and called for a rescue, alerting both the Snowbird Ski Patrol and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, who subsequently accessed and evacuated the victim.",Northwest,,Soft Slab,,1,1,1,"This incident is difficult for many reasons.  We heard of over 10 human triggered avalanches on the day of the fatality, primarily in the upper elevation terrain in the unopened Alta ski area.  Many of those touring these slopes know the terrain well and are used to riding the terrain when the area is open and the ski patrol has already conducted avalanche control work.  There is always a reinforced feeling of safety.This terrain MUST be treated as if it were the backcountry, proper backcountry protocol must be adhered to (riding one at a time, not skiing on top of others, etc), and personal responsibility is critical (ie - be prepared with avalanche rescue gear, 1st aid equipment, and a repair kit.)Another word on the incidents (Gunsight at Alta and this Gad Valley one).  The rescue teams from the ski areas and Wasatch Backcountry Rescue often put their necks out on the line to access and evacuate an injured party.

12,"Heading south on highway 89, just before you get to Fairview, UT, you get a glimpse of the Mountains of the Manti Skyline.One of the most striking features is the Horseshoe bowl with its steep north facing tree chutes.7 Skiers from Utah were captivated by that bowl some time ago.After spending time planning & thinking about the captivating shot, they set out to ski it on March 26th, 2011.These are expert skiers; most of the party has been skiing since childhood.Backcountry experience amongst the members of the group ranges from 2 – 14 years.Each member of the group was carrying beacon, shovel & probe, and they had all practiced with their gear.Most members of the group had taken a Level 1 recreation avalanche course.A few members of the group had read thecurrent avalanche forecastin its entirety which rated the overall hazard as Moderate with pockets of Considerable with “the possibility for deep slab avalanches on steep rocky upper elevation slopes facing the north half of the compass.”The group left the Ephraim Canyon trailhead in the morning in a modern snowcat, reaching the Horseshoe Bowls after a couple hours of travel.Visibility was good, although it was windy, and they noticed a storm brewing to the west on the Nebo side of the valley.The group observed that the Little Shoe Bowl was actively wind loading, so they moved over to the Big Shoe Bowl.Once there, they put one person on belay.That person, now tied in, went out to the massive cornice and started cutting and kicking pieces of cornice onto the slope to test for stability.These cornice drops produced very small loose snow avalanches aka sluffs.The group thought these sluffs were a manageable avalanche hazard & decided to send a two members into the slope to conduct more snow stability testing.A & B got into the upper part of the slope and dug down 6’ or so.They then conducted a few compression tests which resulted in sudden planer shears 16” in depth.All members of the group commented how they didn’t like the results.A & B then moved a few feet to a different location to conduct a few more tests.The results were similar, and the group came to the consensus that they didn’t want to ski this slope.They began gathering their gear to leave the area.At that point C & D were standing near the edge of the cornice which suddenly gave way. C fell with the VW Bus sized piece of cornice that broke off and triggered the large avalanche.C was carried almost all the way down the avalanche path.Viewing from above, D saw C get up and start moving around and for a moment the group thought they had dodged a bullet.They soon realized that A & B had also been caught and carried by the avalanche.D instructed E, F & G who were waiting in the snowcat to call 911 which they did as there is cell service at this location.This call was placed around 11:45am & EMS was mobilized.D then switched his beacon to receive and went down the slope to start the rescue of A & B.As D arrived at the debris pile he found C searching, and C & D got to B who was buried, but had his head & one arm free.They cleared B’s mouth, and then E arrived on the scene and dug B the rest of the way out.Leaving E to continue digging, C & D searched for A’s beacon signal which they quickly acquired.Using their beacons, they followed the flux lines to A’s location and found a ski boot heel on the snow surface.A was almost completely buried, and appeared to have suffered serious trauma during the avalanche.The group worked in shifts to quickly & efficiently dig A out.Once out of the snow,A had no vital signs; he was blue in the face, not breathing and had no pulse.Heroically, the group began the exhausting work of administering CPR.They did so for a full hour.Just as they contemplated stopping, A’s chest rose on its own and a pulse was detected, although he did not regain consciousness.The group administered rescue breaths for the next two hours while keeping A as warm as possible.The group was utterly exhausted at this point, now waiting for SAR teams to reach them to help get them & their critically injured friend up and out of the steep bowl.The party estimates they got to B in 8 minutes & had A dug out 15 minutes after the avalanche was triggered which is nothing short of amazing given the circumstances & the size of the avalanche.At this point SAR teams composed of over 75 volunteers from both Sanpete & Sevier Co. were battling absolutely epic conditions to get to the party waiting in this very remote location.A storm had rolled in and reduced the visibility to just a few feet, further complicating the situation.Eventually, SAR teams were able to deploy over 2100’ of rope to get down to the party.SAR teams brought food, water, started a fire to warm the group and began the long & arduous process of getting the skiers back to the top of the bowl, a distance of over 1000’ vertical feet.In an amazing show of strength and determination, all rescuers and victims were back on top of the ridge near nightfall.By 9:30pm all rescuers and victims were in vehicles heading back towards the highway.Forecasters Comments.Once the avalanche occurred, the party preformed a text book rescue, and really did everything right.Amazingly, they pulled their friend out of the snowpack dead, and brought him back to life.This is an outstanding effort on their part.This accident really comes down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time.While the party was trying to do the right thing by gathering information, they were doing so in the start zone of a major avalanche path, an incredibly hazardous area & high risk activity.Unfortunately, the backcountry snowpack can be a very harsh and unforgiving judge, and the party paid the ultimate price for this mistake in the loss of a loved one.I am deeply saddened by this accident and my thoughts & prayers are with the party this evening.SAR teams were tasked with an incredibly difficult mission in downright nasty conditions.The volunteers who boldly went out into the storm to help the victims truly embody what it is to be a hero.Had the party been forced to endure the cold stormy night out in the elements, the outcome could have been very different.Sanpete & Sevier Co.

13,"Two snowmobilers from Evanston, Wyoming were riding in Humpy Creek drainage in the western Uinta Mountains.  They accessed the area from the trailheads out of Evanston.  They were both experienced, high-end riders and well-known in the commmunity.  They did not plan to ride on steep terrain so they left their beacons and shovels in their vehicles at the trailhead.One rider apparently decided to at least partially ascend ""Cherry Hill"" a popular snowmobile play slope in the drainage north of Superbowl.

15,"Stace Fleming, 48, of Morgan, UT was caught and buried on Grandview Peak on January 29th, which is in the Session Mountains, east of the city of Bountiful. He died two days later on January 31. It occurred on a slope called ""Grand Slam"" by the Wasatch Helicopter Guides, who sometimes ski in the area. He was hill climbing in the area on his snowmobile and on his first descent of a steep, north facing slope, he triggered a very large avalanche and was buried about 5 1/2 feet deep. Apparently, he tried to outrun the avalanche but was bucked off, presumably by hitting the stauchwall of the fractured slab.Wasatch Powderbird Guides happened to be skiing in the area with clients and they noticed the snowmobilers climbing in the area. The next time they looked, they noticed fresh debris with one person on the debris waving his arms. The victim had a beacon and so did his partner, but the partner had not yet located the victim when WPG landed. The guide, Steve Hall, immediately picked up a beacon signal and found the victim within a minute. Since the victim was buried about 5 1/2 feet deep, it took some time to dig him out but they still estimate the total burial time at 15-18 minutes. The victim was not breathing and did not respond to CPR. A medical helicopter was called and Air Med transported him to the hospital.The snowmobile ended up on the surface.  The victim was buried horizontally, face up with his head down slope. He was wearing a helmet and face mask.The avalanche fracture occurred around 9,000' on a north-northwest facing slope of about 38-40 degrees in steepness.  The slab fractured 3-4 feet deep, 250 feet wide, taking out the whole bowl and descended about 1000 vertical feet. From photos posted on theKSL News web site, it appeared that the avalanche fractured to the ground on faceted snow, similar to all the other avalanches this past week.The avalanche danger rating from the Utah Avalanche Center was Considerable with pockets of High with strong warnings to avoid all slopes approaching 35 degrees and steeper.  A Special Avalanche Advisory was also in effect issued through the National Weather Service.The Wasatch Powderbird Guides were the real heros in this rescue. By pure luck, they just happened to be in the area and keeping an eye on the snowmobilers. The fast, and skilled rescue by guide, Steve Hall, was undoubtedly responsible for the live recovery.  Although the victim died a couple days later, we should all appreciate the rescue efforts by Wasatch Powderbird Guides, who have abandoned their guided skiing operations many times through the years to rescue other backcountry parties who have gotten into trouble.Our condolences go out to the victim's family and friends.You can see photos of the site from theKSL News helicopter",North,,Hard Slab,1,,1,1,"Photo by Dan Gardiner, who was snowmobiling in the area.

/*--><!]]>*/The group of 3, Ricardo Presnell (51), Joey and Sarah, met at the mouth of Big Cottonwood Canyon and carpooled up to the Solitude Parking lot.Ricardo, the most experienced and a local, had chosen the tour, which he knew well.He had been touring the previous six days and was familiar with the current snowpack situation.The group skinned to top of Meadow Chutes, in Silver Fork, and skied 2 laps on the upper, lower angel slopes. The third time down was their last, so at the bottom of the upper slopes, they continued down and slightly left, stopping above a large, open convex slope.During this time they had seen no recent avalanches on similar slopes, saw any cracking, or heard any collapses.Ricardo went first, telling other 2 to stay to the right of his tracks when they skied.Ricardo disappeared over the break over after 5 turns.A few seconds later, Joey and Sarah felt and heard a large collapse (whoomph).Then saw a powder cloud and debris running up the opposite side of the valley below.Joey immediately stated, “That’s him. We gotta go.”Rescue:Joey and Sarah moved down the ridge to where they could survey the whole scene.Sarah made a kick turn and traversed into the trees away from the break over and called 911. She then became the communications coordinator, talking with rescue crews and Solitude patrol. Joey safely got onto the bed surface, and began a preliminary search, also looking for clues.Down near the bottom, he got a signal, pin pointed Ricardo’s location, and probed.On the 8thprobe, he got a strike and started digging.About 4’ down, Joey hit Ricardo’s boot, and that was when Ian, a Wasatch Backcountry Rescue (WBR) member from the Solitude Ski Patrol arrived, within 17 minutes of the initial 911 call.Shortly after, two more Solitude patrollers arrived to help dig, and then more rescuers arrived. Ricardo was dug out in approximately 20 minutes.Ricardo was buried about 4 feet deep, on his back, in a wide terrain trap formed by the valley bottom.He was not breathing, had no pulse, and there were signs of trauma from the long ride.Two aspens, one about 5” in diameter had to be sawed to get his body out of the hole.The body was evacuated by WBR and the SL Co Sheriffs.",East,,Hard Slab,1,,1,1,"Joey Klein, the skier in the party who initiated the rescue, stands in the burial hole.  The victim was buried about 4 feet deep, was face up and head toward the avalanche to the left.  The avalanche crossed the creek and partway up the opposite side.  Joey descended from the fracture and found the victim with his beacon, doing a textbook-perfect rescue. He dug for about 5 minutes before the Solitude Ski Patrol arrived and helped dig out the victim.  They had to saw through some aspen trees buried in the debris to free the victim.",,3',8600,,1,,"Wednesday, January 27, 2010",Bruce Tremper and Evelyn Lees,Unknown,"Wednesday, January 27, 2010",Unknown,35,,,Skier,Unintentionally Triggered,600,,Facets,,200,"40.617112000000, -111.623840000000",1,01/27/2010,Salt Lake,Meadows,Skier,/avalanches/17030
17,"Report compiled by Snowbasin Snow Safety:  Frank Waikart, G.R. FletcherReviewed and Published by UAC staff.Events leading up to the accident:The 2009-10 season overall had lacked much of the snow that the local riders have grownaccustomed to. The powder days up through mid January had been few and far between.The month of January was very dry and the snow conditions were thin and very worn out.There was very little enthusiasm for any travel off of the main groomed runs. So whenthere was a report of a large storm, anticipation for new snow was definitely high. Theriding conditions improved each day as the snow continued to fall. By the morning of the24th 36 inches of new snow had made the riding conditions within the resort excellent.For the backcountry there was an avalanche warning in effect and the danger rating wasextreme.On the 24th of January, Ben Pett and Todd Bell had been skiing together all morning.Both of them were familiar with the area as they had been skiing at Snowbasin for sometime. Todd was a former employee of the resort in the mid 90’s and had good knowledgeof the terrain. Todd and Ben decided to head up the John Paul lift and make a run in the NoName area. No Name is known to be the premier powder terrain at Snowbasin ski resortwith a near continuous vertical drop of close to 3000 feet. Adjacent to No Name is easyaccess into uncontrolled backcountry terrain of Hells and Coldwater Canyon.On the lift ride up John Paul Ben stated that he and Todd had a discussion about howdangerous the conditions were in the backcountry, and because of these conditions theirplan was to ski adjacent to the boundary in No Name all the way out to the bottom of theLower Pyramid. They travelled together to near the top of No Name peak where theycaught their breath and put their skis on. Once more they discussed their plan of skiingnear the boundary and staying in bounds. This was the last place/time Ben would seeTodd (approx. 13:00 to 13:05). Ben pushed off and skied a line next to the Gazexexploder (No Name drain) and stopped in the trees on the skier’s left to look for Todd(near the ridgeline and the top of “Lust”). He looked uphill, but didn’t see Todd. Heassumed that they had just gotten separated, so he continued down the run, skiing out theLower Pyramid and coming out at the power station. He stated he reached the bottomaround 13:15. Since Todd was planning to make this his last run, Ben wasn’timmediately alarmed that his friend wasn’t there (or hadn’t waited for him). Ben wasconfident that Todd would be OK because he knew the mountain very well and was anexcellent skier. Ben then called a friend, found out what car Todd was driving, anddiscovered that his car was still in the parking lot. At this point, he became alarmed andnotified dispatch that Todd was missing. By the time he contacted the Ski Patrol theywere well into the recovery operation.Ben stated that Todd was not wearing a beacon. Todd did have a pack, but likely was notcarrying a shovel or probe. Ben was wearing a beacon.Jason Warner a friend of Todd’s also walked into dispatch and stated that Todd was agood skier. He knew the area well, both inbounds and out of bounds. He was veryexperienced in the area. He estimated that Todd had been skiing in Hell’s Canyonhundreds of times.Information from group of snowboarders on scene:On their first “lap through No Name,” a group of 5 snowboarders left the ski area at thetop of No Name, passing the Forest Service brown sign. They noticed 4 or 5 tracks aheadof them, likely snowboard tracks. None in the group carried beacons, shovels or probes,although they usually do have all three with them (gear was in the car). Unaware if theyhad checked the avalanche advisory that day.They rode down the traditional “Sloth Ridge” route and likely rode down “Pride” into“Anger Confluence.” At this point, they noticed fresh debris from an avalanche that hadcome down near the run-out of “Lust.” They reported that it appeared to have run withsome speed and force, as it looked to have washed up over the bank on the observer’s leftof the slide path. They observed dirt in the slide path. Then they continued downdrainage, traversing to the skier’s right of the drainage and debris, attempting to make thetraverse back to the ski area They travelled approximately 100 yards past the confluencewith “Lust” when Nick spotted a jacket on the surface of the snow. The victim was ontheir left, down in the bottom of the drainage. Nick skied down first and wasimmediately joined by the rest of the group. They saw a person (Todd) buried in thesnow. He was sitting upright, leaning uphill, with legs bent, almost in a ball. He had hisfeet downhill and head uphill. His head was covered by approx. 6 inches of snow, butboth knees and an arm were sticking out of the snow. He was found at the toe of thedebris. They described it like the snow had pushed him along to the very end of the slide.Tony seemed to have a basic understanding of CPR and checked for a pulse. The victimwas unresponsive from the start. He did not detect a pulse and the victim was notbreathing. At this point they called 911 and the Weber County dispatcher instructed themto begin CPR. They estimated reaching him at approx. 13:20 and made the 911 call atapprox. 13:22. They performed CPR for approximately 1 hour. They informed theWeber County dispatcher that they were still in a slide path and likely in danger, but saidthe dispatcher instructed them to continue CPR. The 911 dispatcher “called it” after onehour and they stopped CPR.A sixth snowboarder (a friend) was riding solo and joined the group at the scene sometime after they found Todd. This sixth person stated that he followed approximately thesame route as the rest of the group.The victim was described as a male in his mid-40’s. He was wearing a blue jacket, blackpants and blue alpine ski boots. No skis or poles were found on scene. Nothing was onhis head (no goggles/hat/helmet/etc.). He was not wearing gloves, but they found 2gloves, approx. 20 feet uphill from the victim. The gloves were black, Reusch “racing”gloves. He was wearing a pack, but one of the straps had been broken.The group did not have a beacon to mark the victim (in case of subsequent slides), butthey did make an “X” with branches to the skier’s left of the victim, up on a small ridge,approx. 25-30 yards away, out of the slide path.Snowbasin dispatch instructed the group to leave the scene and travel down canyonwhere Ski Patroller Doug Wewer would meet them. Doug had left the ski area boundarynear the intersection of Mustache Ridge and the Dead Deer traverse and traversed toVanity Face. He skinned up from there and travelled to a small sub-ridge just West ofVanity Face, where he could see the lower Hell’s Canyon drainage. The group informedhim that they travelled about 80 to 100 yards down canyon and around a bend before theyfirst made audible/visual contact with each other. Doug dropped into the drainagebottom, met them, discussed the exit plan and escorted them to the power station. Theyall walked together to dispatch and began paperwork.",Northeast,,Hard Slab,,1,1,1,,,2',8600,1,1,,"Sunday, January 24, 2010",Waikart & Fletcher,1:00pm,"Sunday, January 24, 2010",1:00pm,,,,Skier,Unintentionally Triggered,1500,,Facets,,100,"41.215563000000, -111.873307000000",1,01/24/2010,Logan,Hells Canyon,Skier,/avalanches/16995

19,"Four experienced local snowmobilers were riding in the “Rodeo Grounds” area on Christmas Eve morning, the first clear day after several consecutive days under stormy weather conditions. The party triggered a huge hard slab avalanche, which buried and killed two close friends, 22-year-old Erik Jorgensen of Paradise and 23-year-old Jesse Johnson of Hyrum.The avalanche was reported to authorities at around 10:30 am via satellite phone by a member of a separate snowmobiling party. About twenty snowmobilers, who were riding in the area, helped the surviving members of the party with the rescue attempt. From what I could piece together at the scene, one of the victims was very deeply buried in the heavy debris (10-12’ deep). The other was recovered in the vicinity of a grove of large spruce and fir trees. Survival of such a deep burial in avalanche deposition is extremely rare, and trauma due to impacting trees while carried by an avalanche accounts for around 25% of avalanche deaths in North America.The victims were recovered with the aid of avalanche transceivers, which each wore, and probes and shovels. After previous avalanche incidents in the area, extra probes and shovels are cached at a nearby warming hut by Cache Search and Rescue (Cache County Sheriff) and local snowmobilers….

20,"At 12:24 a group of snowboarders was on the high traverse of Northwest Mt. Baldy and watched the avalanche initiate; the crown face bisected the high traverse. The event occurred as they were crossing the slope but did not involve them. According to witness reports from near the starting zone, as the slide was in motion they spotted a person in the middle of the track who was hiking up the slope to retrieve a ski. Warnings were yelled, but when visibility returned, the slope was empty, the alarm was sounded to the ski patrol, and many public skiers and snowboarders in the area began a search for missing people. A hasty search team was immediately dispatched with dogs, beacons, and Recco. Probe teams were assembled and dispatched along with extra probes for the public on scene already searching. Due to approximately 150 people on site, their scattered equipment, and the resulting contamination of the deposition, the dogs had interest in numerous locations but were unable to locate the victim. The victim, a 27-year-old female, was the same person who had been seen hiking in the track.

Two of his friends watched  from a distance and discussed going to help their companion and started putting their helmets on. They don’t know how  the avalanche was triggered, but they heard something and noticed the avalanche breaking well above Dale, quickly engulfing all  three riders.

Authorities said 53-year-old Dave Balls was snowmobiling in an area known as the Super Bowl on the east side of Windy Beak in the Whitney Basin area on Tuesday when he died in an avalanche.""He was buried for over an hour and a half,"" the Utah Avalanche Center said in a statement on its Web site Wednesday. ""He was not wearing a beacon and was found with an organized probe line.""Authorities were expected to investigate the cause of the slide today. The Utah Avalanche Center said the slide was as much as 400 feet wide and 4 feet deep.""Wind loading on a weak faceted snowpack is the most likely structure,"" the Web siteutahavalanchecenter.comsaid.Balls' family released a statement Wednesday saying David was snowmobiling with his sons in an area they were all familiar with. Balls and his sons were ""very experienced"" snowmobilers, the statement said.He was the founder and owner of Valley Ready Mix, which he ran with his brother-in-law Brent Baker.Balls is the second person to die in an avalanche this week. An 11-year-old boy is making a remarkable recovery after he was buried for 33 minutes in an avalanche on Sunday.Max Zilvitis was one of three skiers trapped in an avalanche on an inbounds trail at The Canyons. Jesse R. Williams, 30, of Grand Junction, Colo. died of head trauma when the slide carried him into a tree. Zilvitis and his father, Brian, were also caught in the slide.""A man and a child below were engulfed, with the man partially buried and the child totally buried,"" according to a report from the Avalanche Forecast Center.""The father was able to dig himself out while his son remained completely buried. The ski patrol arrived and performed an outstanding rescue. They set up a probe line using volunteers on the scene. Within minutes, there was a strike by a 15-year-old girl that was on the probe line that the snow safety had organized, and the boy was excavated from the debris with no pulse or respirations.""Monday afternoon Max regained consciousness and has made dramatic improvement each day. Wednesday, Primary Children's Medical Center listed him in good condition and said he had been taken out of intensive care.Brian and Samantha Zilvitis, of Park City, released a statement Wednesday about their son's recovery.KSLMore snowmobilers getting caught in avalanchesDecember 26th, 2007 @ 6:02pmJohn Hollenhorst reportingMore snow fell today, and more is in the forecast, all adding to the danger of an avalanche season that has killed two people in the past few days.The most recent fatality is David Balls of Oakley. He died yesterday while snowmobiling in the mountains above that town. That death highlights a strong trend that's taken place over the last 30 years: Snowmobiling has replaced backcountry skiing as the leading cause of fatal avalanches.A lot of people feel very powerful when they're on a snowmobile, but they are no match for the power of nature when snow starts to slide. Backcountry skiers have learned the hard way for many years. In recent years, snowmobilers have been forced to learn the same lessons.A safety video put together by the Utah Avalanche Center shows that winter sports can be exhilarating, spectacular and terrifying. ""Getting caught in an avalanche is kind of like being in a car wreck. I mean you just don't want to be in one,"" one skier says.Daredevil backcountry skiers and mountain climbers used to be the recreationists most at risk. But since the 1980s, avalanches are increasingly a phenomenon of snowmobiles.""It used to be snowmobiles couldn't get back into areas that normally people could hike or ski into,"" explained Eric Stucki, of Utah State Parks and Recreation.New powerful machines now routinely go where angels fear to tread.For a half century, avalanche deaths have been steadily increasing. Over time, the death rates have shifted. Skier and climber deaths have declined, relatively, while snowmobiler deaths have shot up to about 40 percent of all avalanche deaths.Experts now stress avalanche training and equipment--probe poles, locater beacons, and shovels--for all backcountry snowmobilers, and the safety gear ought to be on the rider, not the machine, in case they get separated.""They're just kind of on the back side of the learning curve a little bit maybe,"" Brett Kobernick, of the Utah Avalanche Center, said. ""They're kind of in the same boat that skiers and snowboarders were 10 or 15 years ago.""The goal, of course, is to never have to use avalanche tools, to avoid going into areas when they're dangerous. ""As long as you check the forecast, as long as you know before you go, I think they can go back into those areas, as long as they are prepared,"" Stucki said.In other words, get information so you know when to go and when to stay home. ""Keep in contact with what the current conditions are, and that way they can make wise and informed decisions when they travel into the backcountry,"" Kobernick said.The Utah Avalanche Center now provides forecasts specifically tailored to snowmobilers, and they do educational programs for all sorts of different groups.The experts Eyewitness News talked to say the message is sinking in, and snowmobilers are much more safety conscious than they used to be.UPI.comOAKLEY, Utah, Dec. 26 (UPI) -- A father of six was killed in a 400-foot-wide avalanche in Summit County, Utah, the second victim of a local avalanche this week.Bishop Howard Sorensen, a local religious leader, said Dave Balls, 53, was snowmobiling with his four sons when he was unable to avoid the avalanche and was lost in a wave of snow, The Salt Lake Tribune reported Wednesday.""He was up enjoying the day when the slide broke loose,"" Sorensen said of accident Tuesday. ""He just wasn't able to out run (it).""Along with his four sons, who managed to avoid the avalanche, Balls had two adopted daughters from Russia, the Tribune said.The newspaper said that Balls' death came in the wake of last weekend's avalanche in Summit County that claimed the life of 30-year-old Colorado native Jesse R.

It was the first death of the avalanche season. The skiers were in the Red Pine Chutes area when the avalanche began just after 11:15 a.m., said resort spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. The man - 25 to 35 years old and possibly a Colorado resident - was found about 10 minutes later, but died at the scene, she said. A friend of the man suffered minor injuries. The 11-year-old was skiing at the bottom of the double black-diamond run with his father when he was caught up in the slide, Summit County sheriff's Capt. Andrew Leatham said. Three women witnessed the avalanche; one found the boy about 30 minutes later with her ski pole. Rescuers performed CPR, and the boy was flown to Primary Children's Medical Center, Leatham said. As of late Sunday afternoon, the boy was in intensive care and doctors were warming his core temperature, he said. The slide occurred within resort boundaries, in an area that had opened Saturday, Dowd said. Explosives, a snow pack assessment and a test ski had been administered at the avalanche site less than a day before the slide, she said. ""Aggressive avalanche control work had been performed at The Canyons throughout the week as new snow fell,"" she said. Investigators didn't know what triggered the slide, which was 125 feet wide and 500 feet long. The depth ranged from 3 inches to 5 feet. Avalanche deaths are ""very rare"" in ski resorts, said Brett Kobernik, forecaster for the Utah Avalanche Center. ""It's only happened a handful of times since the resorts have opened here,"" he said. The avalanche danger in the area Sunday was considerable, according to the center, which warned that dangerous human-triggered slides were likely. The risk was expected to remain today, Kobernik said. ""The avalanche danger will be on the rise again on the back country . . . due to more snow and stronger winds,"" he said.Desert NewsFrom Deseret News archives:Man killed, boy injured in avalanche at The CanyonsByRebecca PalmerDeseret NewsPublished: Sunday, Dec. 23, 2007 7:40 p.m. MSTAn avalanche at The Canyons resort in Park City left one man dead and a juvenile critically injured late Sunday morning.The avalanche at the ski resort occurred at 11:17 a.m., according to the Summit County Sheriff's Office. Skiers who saw the crash and Canyons ski patrol teams were on the scene within minutes. Sheriff's deputies also were called to the area of the slide.Eight minutes after the avalanche, the body of a man between the ages of 25 and 30 was found. Paramedics immediately began attempting resuscitation, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.Twenty-five minutes after the first man was found, an adolescent boy was discovered and pulled from the snow and ice. He was unconscious but later was revived and taken to a Salt Lake area hospital, said Summit County Sheriff Dave Edmunds. Sunday night he was reported in critical but stable condition.Neither the identity nor the hometown of either person was released Sunday evening, pending family notification, Edmunds said. Police did not believe Sunday that the two had any relation to one another.The man and boy were found within bounds near the Red Pine Chutes area, according to The Canyons spokeswoman Elizabeth Dowd. Officials are unsure whether the avalanche, which they called of substantial size, started within bounds.The Canyons has participated in aggressive avalanche control in the area of Sunday's slide, Dowd said. Explosives and other safety measures were performed within 24 hours of the fatal avalanche.However, the Utah Avalanche Center has listed slide danger in the area of the western Uintas as considerable. The center does not list specific data for The Canyons on its Web site atwww.avalanche.org.Sunday's fatal slide caused The Canyons resort's second death within just eight days. On Dec. 17, a Park City attorney died after striking a tree and breaking his neck near the Lower Crowning Glory run at the resort.So far in winter 2007, Utah has seen three injury-causing avalanche accidents. according to the avalanche center. The first two occurred Dec. 13 at Pioneer Ridge and Hidden Canyon, both in the Salt Lake area.In the 2006-2007 winter season, Utah had seven injury-causing avalanches. At least 10 people were hurt in locations ranging from Ogden to the Uintas to Salt Lake City. Utah also had five injury-causing avalanches in the previous winter season and nine the year before.Avalanche experts recommend that skiers, snowmobilers and snowboarders learn about the dangers of slides before hitting the slopes. They also recommend carrying safety gear such as beacons, probes, shovels and a lightweight backpack. Most avalanche victims have only 15 minutes to live after being buried in snow, according to the avalanche center.",,3.5',9700,1,1,,"Monday, December 24, 2007","Brett Kobernik, Evelyn Lees",Unknown,"Sunday, December 23, 2007",Unknown,39,,,Skier,Unintentionally Triggered,600,,Facets,,100,"40.660164000000, -111.596117000000",1,12/23/2007,Salt Lake,Canyons Ski Resort,Skier,/avalanches/17452

25,"Note: most of this information was provided by the Snowbasin Ski Patrol.  UAC staff did not directly investigate the accident because of lingering, dangerous avalanche conditions and poor weather conditions.Events leading up to the accident:A  father and his two sons were skiing at Snowbasin resort.  Later in the  day, they headed out-of-bounds into the Hell’s Canyon area, an area  north of Snowbasin where avalanche hazard is not mitigated with  explosives, nor patrolled.  Their objective was to ski powder.  The  group had little or no avalanche training and had no rescue gear.  While  descending, the sons skied ahead of their father and got separated.   The details are not clear, but a slide was triggered and Brian Schwartz  the seventeen year-old son was caught in the slide.  Brian was swept  approximately 1500 vertical feet down the slope and was buried.  He had  significant trauma to his face and head and appeared to have died of  trauma.   Brian’s father and other bother arrived at the site some time  after the slide had happened.  They found one of Brian’s skis and  continued to look for him around the area.  Soon afterwards two  snowboarders arrived and saw what had happened.  They also found a  helmet and liner below the toe of the debris.  They immediately came to  dispatch to report the incident.  The father and brother were also  brought to dispatch shortly after.Rescue:Ski  Patrol dispatched an initial response task force.  This was made up of  two teams; the first team came in from above; 3 pros and one dog.  A  second team came in from below via snowmobile and foot; two pros and a  dog.  The first team arrived and searched the pile with beacons, Reccos,  dog and spot probing.  The second team arrived and also searched with  dog and spot probing.  After the initial search came up negative a first  column was dispatched from the top.  This included 4 pros with  avalanche rescue gear.  When the first column arrived a probe line was  started.  After probing for nearly an hour a strike was made and Brian’s  body was recovered approximately 6 feet under.  Although he appeared  dead rescue efforts were taken until a life flight helicopter could host  the body back to the base of Snowbasin.

26,"Five young snowmobilers, four males and one female (16-19 years old), began their day snowmobiling in the terrain surrounding the accident site. Most of them were wearing avalanche rescue gear, though those details are still being sifted through. Many clues to instability were missed along the way, including natural avalanches close to the accident site. In addition, at least one large hard slab avalanche was triggered without incident, about a ¼ mile north of the accident site prior to the fatality. This slide was 2’-3’ deep, 250’ wide, running about 150’ vertically. It most likely emboldened the group, luring them deeper into the avalanche dragons den. This group was very familiar with the terrain and had triggered small avalanches in the area on past outings.Around16:00the group traveled to the southwest of the avalanche they just triggered and regrouped at the bottom of a south facing slope. Several riders climbed the 32 degree slope above them without incident. Sixteen year old Zachary Holmes began climbing the slope too, but when he neared the top, he began “side-hilling” towards a steeper adjacent slope which had more of an easterly aspect. As he changed aspect and slope angle, he triggered a large hard slab avalanche 2’-4’ deep and 300’-325’ wide.His partners turned their beacons on to receive and began searching. There was plenty of confusion and several random holes were dug 75’ uphill from where Zachary was finally located, buried 3’ under his snowmobile which was sticking out of the snow. After he was found, two young men stayed on the scene and began CPR while a male and female rode back to the trailhead to make a cell phone call and alert local authorities. Much to their dismay their phones didn’t work at the trailhead, but a family with an “OnStar” system in the vehicle placed a call and Wasatch County Search and Rescue was dispatched.Back at the scene, as the older brother performed CPR an Airmed helicopter located the accident site and dropped a flight nurse off at the scene.

The clothing items are consistent with those reportedly worn by Higgins, though no positive identification of the body has been made.Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Harris said a search-and-rescue plane has been flying over the area every three days, weather permitting, since an avalanche on Dec. 31, 2005, buried Higgins, 31, of Salt Lake City.After spotting the clothing, search and rescue efforts were organized for Friday afternoon. Harris said the body was three to four miles away from the Aspen Grove area.When searchers arrived at the body, they used ice picks and shovels to dig a hole 12 feet in circumference and 7 feet deep through three layers of ice, according to a Utah County press release.They reported that each layer of ice was 2-6 inches deep.Before searchers could take the body down the mountain, a thunderstorm suspended the search, the release stated. They decided to spend the night on the mountain with the body, which was fitted for transport on a stokes litter.The body is ready for Life Flight, and searchers hope the helicopter will be able to take the body off the mountain today, the release said.Searchers have been looking for Higgins since the avalanche. Searches days after the incident had to be called off because of weather and potential avalanche danger to rescuers.Searches organized in the spring were called off because of too much snow in the area, though searchers have hiked through the area looking for Higgins since the snow started melting.They have not identified the body yet, but there are no other missing persons reported to be in the area, Harris said.Natalie Evans is available at 344-2561. ornevans@heraldextra.com.Please visit:www.sltrib.comArticle Last Updated: 1/02/2006 12:39 AMSalt Lake man presumed dead in avalancheSearch suspended: A Salt Lake City man is presumed dead, but a missing teen is found near SnowbirdBy Jason BergreenThe Salt Lake TribuneSalt Lake TribuneASPEN GROVE - Just before Marshall Higgins headed out for a snowshoeing excursion into the high mountains east of Provo, Jeff Frederick took a photo of his friend in the pre-dawn darkness of Aspen Grove.On Sunday, that photo was tacked to the inside wall of a Utah County sheriff's mobile command center as helicopters waited to get to the mountainside where Higgins had been swept away in an avalanche on Saturday. By midafternoon, authorities told Higgins' family that the search had been deemed a search and recovery, not a search and rescue. A short time later, weather and snow conditions forced temporary cancellation of the search.Earlier, Higgins' brother Adam Higgins, said the family was aware that change in the status of the search meant Higgins likely had died. ""It was disheartening but expected,"" he said. ''We're so grateful Jeff came out of it.''Higgins, 31, and Frederick, both of Salt Lake City, had hiked for more than five hours to an altitude of about 10,300 feet near Hidden Lakes when the slide engulfed them. Frederick was able to ride it out, clutching a tree to stop. He searched for his friend, then used his cell phone to call for help. A Utah Department of Safety helicopter plucked him to safety at about 4:30 p.m. Saturday.Also on Sunday, a 16-year-old California boy who had gone missing in an out-of-bounds area of Snowbird ski resort was found alive and in good condition at about 11:20 a.m.Snowbird spokeswoman Laura Schaffer said the boy built a snow cave in Mineral Basin, in the north fork of American Fork Canyon, and emerged at about 10 a.m. Sunday and flagged down a search helicopter.""He was a smart kid, and the clear weather today, those were the saving graces in this situation,"" she said. The boy's parents declined to release their and their son's names and hometown, she said.In the search for Higgins on Sunday, Wasatch Powderbird Guides dropped 29 explosive charges to knock loose any potential avalanches before search crews were to be flown in. But shifting winds and intermittent cloud cover forced authorities to call off the search, and Utah County Sheriff James Tracy said forecasts of another storm system meant it would not resume today.Tracy said weather and conditions would determine when the search would continue.Higgins' brothers described him as a sociable guy who made friends easily. An experienced snowshoer and outdoorsman, he had ventured into the area several times in years past, his brother Brandon Higgins said. This was his first foray there this winter; Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Darren Gilbert said Saturday neither man had an avalanche beacon on this trip.Frederick declined to speak to reporters Sunday at Aspen Grove.Higgins is survived by his wife, Kelly, and daughters Hannah, 3, and 2-year-old Emilee.His presumed death is the first this season. By this time last year, four people had died in avalanches, and a total of eight would perish, making that season one of the deadliest since records have been kept.Saturday's avalanche was near where three men died on Dec. 26, 2003. They were among a group of five who were swept down as they snowboarded in the Roberts Horn Chute of Aspen Grove, about 2 1/2 miles north of Sundance Ski Resort.The California boy apparently slipped through two rope barriers at about 1:30 p.m. Saturday to get to the out-of-bounds backcountry, Snowbird's Schaffer said Sunday. He was reported missing about 4 p.m., and the ski patrol and dogs searched for him until 11:30 p.m., when conditions were deemed too unsafe, Schaffer said.During that time, the boy carved out a snow cave for refuge, she said, adding that he had heard snowcats about 100 yards away at about 10 p.m. that night but was ""too tired"" to flag them down. The boy slept in the cave through the night, awakening at 10 a.m. Sunday to the sound of a helicopter. He waved to it and was rescued about 90 minutes later.The boy and his parents had been skiing and boarding, but when he went missing he was with some cousins, Schaffer said.Salt Lake County sheriff's Sgt. Todd Griffiths said the boy would not be penalized for leaving the resort's boundaries. ''He basically got lost, went off a small hill and got in an area where he felt he could not hike out,'' he said.In all, the ski patrol, Wasatch Powerbird Guides and representatives of five counties - Salt Lake, Weber, Utah, Davis and Wasatch, contributed to the two searches.Tribune reporter Nate Carlisle and editor Peg McEntee contributed to this report.",,unknown,11000,,1,,"Sunday, January 1, 2006",Brett Kobernik,Unknown,"Saturday, December 31, 2005",Unknown,,,,Unknown,,Unknown,,,,Unknown,"40.388920000000, -111.640491000000",1,12/31/2005,Provo,Timpanogos,Unknown,/avalanches/17440
31,"Accident Summery:On Thursday March 31st a group of five snowmobilers left the Monte Cristo trailhead, located nearOgden,Utah, for a day of snowmobiling. The terrain is relatively benign and is an area many locals go to when there is an avalanche danger on nearby steep, climbing hills. The group was very familiar with the terrain and was thinking about the avalanche conditions, and they were all wearing beacons, shovels, and probes.Four of the riders stopped on top of a slope just to the south of “Whiskey Hill”. The fifthsledderand avalanche victim passed by them, and much to everyone’s surprise began descending a steep adjacent slope to the south, namedEcclesPeak.The snowmobiler was only about 20’ onto the slope when he propagated a large avalanche.Rescue Summery:One of the members of the party drove to the top of the slope, got off his machine and ran down the bed surface while the rest of the party approached from the bottom of the slope.

He wasn’t conscious or breathing andc.p.r. was performed. At approx. 10:51 a cell phone call was made to 911 and both the Rich County Sheriff and Life Flight responded. While a coroners report was not yet available, it seems that massive chest trauma was the cause of death.",Northeast,,Hard Slab,,1,1,1,"Whiskey Hill, South(Eccles Peak)      3/31/2005Images by Toby Weed from 4/1/2005Tragically, a 27 year-old snowmobiler from Farr West died after triggering this avalanche on the last day of March.  He is the 8th person to die in an avalanche in the Utah backcountry this season.The deadly avalanche occurred on a steep wind-drifted slope just south of the slope known as ""Whiskey Hill.""  ""Whiskey Hill"" is on Eccles Peak off the snow-covered Curtis Creek Road, and because hwy 39 is closed in the winter, it is accessible for snowmobilers from either Monte Cristo trail-head (west side near Huntsville and east side near Woodruff).The slope that avalanched is just a little steeper than Whiskey Hill, (the tracked slope on the right or to the north).  It faces just a little more north, it's shallower and it may have picked up a bit more wind-deposited snow.The hard slab avalanche was over 500 feet wide and averaged 4  feet deep at the crown.  The short slope is very steep ( 38 to 45 degrees  in slope steepness).Utah Avalanche Center forecaster, Craig Gordon, has to kick his boot toes into the solid bed-surface in route to the crown.The  northeast facing slope at just under 9000' in elevation is a classic avalanche  trap.    Prevailing winds drift tons of snow from a large open  flat area to the west of the slope and deposit it here as they decelerate.   It is  a perfect lee-slope fetch area.To make matters worse, snow sliding off this slope runs smack into, and then strains through a wall of mature conifers.  The unlucky snowmobiler probably died from massive trauma inflicted by the trees as he was pushed through them by the avalanche.Craig Gordon examines the mechanical properties of the avalanche by digging above the crown.  Up there he can test snow that is undisturbed by the avalanche.  It's important for us to look at avalanches.  We compare what we find in the crown profile of the avalanche path to the snow profiles of slopes in the region that haven't avalanched.  Is there a similar combination of a stiff slab and a thin sugary weak layer?  If so, we must suspect that other human triggered avalanches are possible.The stiff wind-deposited slab failed on a thin sugary or faceted layer capped  by a dirty wind-crust in early March.  The rest of the solid slab consists of snow  deposited in the last 2 big March storms (3/20-2/23 and 3/28-3/30).The cornice above shows us that wind deposited snow builds up on the slope below.  Prevailing winds scour snow off an expansive flat open ridge-top and can rapidly deposit tons of snow onto this steep northeast facing slope.A single track descending into the middle of the avalanche tells the story.  A snowmobiler rode past his party and down the steep slope.  The avalanche released when he was about 20' into it, right at a steep rocky roll-over where the remaining snow is shallow and weak.  The track enters the slide path in the center, and the slab pulled out a couple hundred feet on either side.He might have been able to ride out the avalanche if it were on an open slope, but instead he was driven into an unforgiving grove.   These trees are directly in the fall-line below the tracks leading into the avalanche.Tons of snow strained through the trees and piled up deeply around them.  This is looking up at the crown from near the burial site.Here is the burial site in a large pile of snow on the downhill side of these trees.  Given the situation, the rider was found quickly by his party who were all equipped with beacons, probes and shovels.  Even so, he died, most likely as a result of trauma.  Statistics show that at least a quarter (or 25%) of avalanche fatalities can be blamed on trauma.

The party knew about the avalanche danger because they discussed it at length the previous night.They decided to go into the backcountry that day because it looked like a number of other people were doing it without incident.They hiked the 200 yards to the top of Peak 9990 and left from the backcountry access gate, which is clearly marked with several signs warning of the danger.To leave the boundary, one must push open a gate with a large, white sign attached showinga skulland crossbones marked in large letters “You May Die”.It is legal to access the backcountry, which National Forest, but the Canyons Resorts wants to make sure everyone knows that there is no avalanche control beyond their rope lines.They hiked south along the ridge about a half mile to the top of Dutch Draw.On the way, they passed one avalanche path that had dozens of tracks in it and they went to the next path locally known as “Conehead” because of its shape from a distance.They hiked to thehigh point, which had only a few tracks in it and decided that it was too dangerous and they backtracked to an area where the slope angle is gentler and they could utilize an island of thick conifer trees to safely get down into the upper third of the slope.They descended through the island of trees and they planned to enter the slope from the side by passing beneath a vertical cliff band.Onesnowboarderenteredthe slope below the cliff andShaneMaixner, 27, decided to jump off the lower portion of the cliff onto the slope—a drop of about 20 feet.He appeared to trigger the avalanche when he landed and he was engulfed in the slide.The first snowboarder managed to escape off the nearby flank of the avalanche.Rescue Summary:The group of snowboarders descended the avalanche bed surface and began probing with tree branches for their friend.They also called 911 on their cell phone and ski patrol from the Canyons Resort responded within about 20 minutes.After rescuers determined that the party did not have beacons and that they did not get any beacon signals from the rest of the debris, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to put a larger group of rescuers onto the slope.They escorted the remaining four snowboarders out of the area and WasatchPowderbirdGuides dropped explosives onto the upper part of the avalanche path.They triggered the next slope to the north with another large, hard slab avalanche, which was not quite as large as the original slide, but they did not trigger anyhangfireabove the original avalanche.The Summit County Sheriff took over the rescue and brought in a larger team from the Summit County Search and Rescue along with personnel from Wasatch Backcountry Rescue.They used avalanche rescue dogs and probes.They finally found the body of ShaneMaixnertwo days after the accident, buried four feet deep in a grove of trees on the extreme north edge of the avalanche path.It proved very difficult to know how many people were caught in the slide because of widely conflicting witness accounts.The original party of snowboarders reported that they believed that they were alone in the bowl.They did not notice any one else.Three other parties, however, reported other people in the bowl.First, a party at the top of the slope was video taping the scenery from the ridge when they heard the roar of the avalanche.When they looked over the edge and continued to video the slide.The tape, reportedly, was of poor quality and inconclusive about other parties in the bowl.Second, two snowboarders were building jumps on the flats below just to the north of the avalancherunoutand they were adamant that they saw others on the slope and were able to give descriptions of clothing and exact locations.Third, a party hiking up to the backcountry access point from the top of the 9990 lift claimed to see a lone skier going across the flats at the bottom, who was overcome by the slide.Since many of the people who ski at the Canyons Resort are on vacation, it was very difficult to know who was missing at the end of the day.In fact, it took until January 17th—three days after the accident, to whittle the list down.The Summit County Sheriff announced that there was likely only one fatality and he called off the search.Media interest was intense because the some witnesses to the avalanche initially indicated that there may have been 15 people buried.On the heels of the large mudslides inCalifornia, the national media arrived in droves and it became headline news across the country and the lead story in many of the television news programs for the next several days.",Northeast,,Hard Slab,1,,1,1,CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS,,6',9800,,1,Dutch's Draw,"Friday, January 14, 2005",Bruce Tremper,Unknown,"Friday, January 14, 2005",Unknown,,,,Snowboarder,Unintentionally Triggered,1000,,Facets,,400,"40.651471000000, -111.592426000000",1,01/14/2005,Salt Lake,Dutch Draw,Snowboarder,/avalanches/17436

35,"Accident Summary:Two snowshoers were reported as overdue when they failed to return from a walk up Mineral Fork on Saturday, December 11th.Victim are BruceQuint, 59, and Melvin Dennis, 37, both fromSalt Lake City.Rescue Summary:Saturday night, two skiers from Salt Lake Country Search and Rescue followed snowshoe tracks to the base of a large headwall at the upper end of Mineral Fork where the tracks disappear under fresh avalanche debris and did not appear again on the other side.The two snowshoers were the first people to travel up Mineral Fork after the large storm, which ended two days earlier.Searchers could find no beacon signals in the debris, nor visual clues.Neither of the victims wore beacons.  In consultation with several avalanche experts, including one who flew over the area in a helicopter that night, they decided that conditions were too dangerous to bring in a larger team of searchers that night.On Sunday morning personnel from Wasatch Powderbird Guides controlled the area with explosives, which triggered widespread avalanches in remainder of the canyon as well as hang fire above the accident site.They flew teams of rescuers to the site including Salt Lake County Sheriff’s Search and Rescue, Wasatch Backcountry Rescue, a volunteer group of ski area personnel operating under the Salt Lake County Sheriff.The helicopter was from Utah Highway Patrol.They searched the area using trained avalanche rescue dogs and probed areas where the dogs indicated interest.At 11:30, they found Melvin Dennis buried about four feet deep and more-or-less in line with the tracks which entered the debris.They found the second victim BruceQuint, on Monday, December 13, 2004 around 10:00 am about 25 yards uphill from the first victim and buried over eight feet deep.Both victims appeared to have been simply pushed over by the debris and buried without being tumbled and were probably buried fairly near their initial positions.",Northeast,,Hard Slab,2,,2,2,PHOTOS:SeePhotos.,,2.5',9000,,2,Mineral Fork,"Sunday, December 12, 2004",Bruce Tremper,Unknown,"Saturday, December 11, 2004",Unknown,,,,Unknown,,800,,Facets,,400,"40.607425000000, -111.683214000000",2,12/11/2004,Salt Lake,Mineral Fork,Unknown,/avalanches/17431
36,"Accident Summary:Two males had been snowmobiling in the upper Trout Creek drainage. They decided to go to a slope very familiar to them. At around11:30they arrived at the base of the slope. They decided the more experienced of the two, who was wearing a beacon and did have a shovel, would attempt to climb the slope first. About mid way up, he got his machine stuck. He worked on it for a while, got hot and took off his helmet. While he was trying to get unstuck his partner, who had no rescue gear, climbed an adjacent slope. His intention was to get high enough on the slope in order to ride down to the stuck machine and assist in the excavation. As the witness got to the top of a bench he saw the crown start to propagate on the same slope the victim was on. The witness realized a large avalanche had been triggered. He circled back around to find no sign of the victim.Rescue Summary:The witness rode his machine to a nearby ridge and called 911. He also flagged down 3 or 4 riders to help him with the search. They followed him back and began probing likely areas with broken branches. The witness then jumped back on his machine and climbed another ridge and flagged down two riders who had beacons, shovels, and probes. They returned to the scene and found the victim within 5-7 minutes after their arrival using their beacons.It took another 7-10 minutes to dig him out.

40,"During the second half of January various backcountry travelers triggered about a dozen large avalanches in the backcountry on the January 6th crust, which caught people on three different occasions. Finally, on January 31st, the inevitable happened—the first fatality occurred on that fateful layer.The death of Brian Roust shook the avalanche community to its core because Brian was not only a fellow avalanche worker, but he was very experienced and cagy. Yes, Brian fit the description of the typical avalanche victim as he was male in his late 20’s and was very skilled in his sport. But he did not fit the profile in that he was a very experienced avalanche worker who had patrolled at Park City and was a route leader at the Canyons Resort at the time of the accident. Not many avalanche professionals die in avalanches.Brian was skiing in one of his favorite backcountry areas on the Thousand Peaks Ranch, which is private land in the western Uinta Mountains in the Weber River drainage east of Oakley. At least three different parties were skiing in the area and one party of four had skied in the area the day before. As the party of four skied one bowl, Brian and his partner skied an adjacent bowl with his two dogs. The party in the other bowl triggered a large avalanche some distance away from their ski track but no one was caught. Brian and his partner saw this avalanche occur and were on their way back up to the top to regroup with others and talk about the situation.Brian, a notoriously fit backcountry skier, was out ahead of his partner as they climbed. When Brian neared the top of the slope, he triggered the avalanche that killed him. We do not know yet whether he was going up or down when he triggered the avalanche. The avalanche carried Brian and his dog down the slope and buried them.Brian’s partner and members of the other party searched the debris with avalanche rescue beacons. The first beacon they found was loose in the snow and not attached to anything—which was a beacon that Brian had attached to his dog and the avalanche had apparently stripped off. The searchers found Brian when they located the second beacon, buried 4 feet deep and he was apparently dead from the trauma of hitting trees on the way down.We do not know whether Brian called the avalanche report before heading out, although the Uinta Mountains are outside our forecast area. On that day, Tom Kimbrough’s forecast prophetically called the conditions “tricky and dangerous” and that the avalanches “break unexpectedly above you and wider than usual.”On the same day, an experienced ski patroller triggered an avalanche in the backcountry of Cardiff fork, and rode the avalanche about 1000 vertical feet.",Northeast,,,1,,1,1,,,,9400,,1,Windy Ridge; One drainage east of Stillman Creek,"Thursday, October 23, 2014",UAC Staff,12:30pm,"Thursday, January 31, 2002",12:30pm,,,,Skier,,,,,,,"40.811451136089, -111.108642958010",1,01/31/2002,Uintas,Windy Ridge,Skier,/avalanches/21855
41,"During very warm, springtime conditions, a local doctor and his friend from Alaska (also a doctor) left at 4:00 am on April 28th to climb Stairs Gulch with crampons, ice axes and a rope, but no beacons. Stairs Gulch is a very steep and very large avalanche path (5,000 vertical feet) near the bottom of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Few people venture into Stairs Gulch during the winter but sometimes climbers like to test their snow skills there in spring. As the pair ascended in the early morning darkness a large glide avalanche released high above them and descended into the narrow gully they were ascending. When they failed to show up by their scheduled noon return time, searchers found the boot of one victim sticking out of the snow and a search dog located the second victim about four hundred yards above the first victim and he was buried about 8 feet deep.This is the first known fatality from a glide avalanche in Utah and perhaps the only one in the U.S. Glide avalanches occur when wet snow slides slowly on the ground, similar to a glacier, often for several days, until they randomly release.",,Glide,,1,1,2,2,,,,,,2,Stairs Gulch,"Thursday, October 23, 2014",UAC Staff,,"Saturday, April 28, 2001","Saturday, April 28, 2001",,,,Natural,,,,,,,"40.613918777396, -111.736453042870",2,04/28/2001,Salt Lake,Stairs Gulch,Natural,/avalanches/21853
